# Demo task.

Write python program to solve [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) 
```python
a * x * x + b * x + c == 0 
```
Result should be sorted by ascential order.

__Examples__:
```python

>>> solution(a=1, b=6, c=5)
(-5, -1)
>>> solution(a=1, b=4, c=4)
(-2,)
>>> solution(a=1, b=6, c=45)
()
```


___*Please keep in mind the following___:
 
- _Do not use the "input" function to enter initial parameters for your task solution._  
- _Do not use the "print" function to return results from your task solution. Do not delete code from the template or change predefined - functions._
- _Put your solution in the section marked with the comment "Put your code here." You can still use your own functions and define them outside the predefined function._
